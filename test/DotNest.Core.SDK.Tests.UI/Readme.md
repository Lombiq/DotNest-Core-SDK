# DotNest Core SDK UI Tests

## Overview

This project contains a sample UI test for the DotNest Core SDK, which ensures that basic functionality is working. You can use it as a starting point for your own UI tests. The project uses [Lombiq.Tests.UI module](https://github.com/Lombiq/UI-Testing-Toolbox/blob/dev/Readme.md) which gives you a base for writing UI tests. For more info please check out the [Lombiq.Tests.UI repository](https://github.com/Lombiq/UI-Testing-Toolbox/blob/dev/Readme.md). For more UI test examples see the [Lombiq.Tests.UI.Samples repository](https://github.com/Lombiq/UI-Testing-Toolbox/blob/dev/Lombiq.Tests.UI.Samples/Readme.md).
