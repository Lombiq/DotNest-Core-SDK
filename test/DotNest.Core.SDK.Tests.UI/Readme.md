# DotNest Core SDK UI Tests

## Overview

This project contains a sample UI test for the DotNest Core SDK, which ensures that basic functionality is working. You can use it as a starting point for your own UI tests. The project uses the [Lombiq UI Testing Toolbox for Orchard Core project](https://github.com/Lombiq/UI-Testing-Toolbox) which gives you a framework for writing UI tests. For more info please check out its documentation. For more UI test examples see the [`Lombiq.Tests.UI.Samples` repository](https://github.com/Lombiq/UI-Testing-Toolbox/blob/dev/Lombiq.Tests.UI.Samples/Readme.md).
